  <div id="myDiv">
    This text will disappear!
  </div>
  <script>
    document.getElementById("myDiv").style.display = "none";
    //The bug is that the script is running before the element is fully loaded.
    //The solution is to either move the script to the end of the body or use DOMContentLoaded
  </script>
